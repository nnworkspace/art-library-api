Home -> WIP
WIP -> CancelWIP -> Home
WIP -> ArtworkData(artworkName, artworkType, authors, serialNumber, 
                description, obtainDate, storageLocationId, photos) -> WIP
WIP -> LendingData(lenderId, artworkId, lendingDate, lendingPeriod, inUseLocationId) -> WIP
WIP -> FinalizeWIP -> Home
